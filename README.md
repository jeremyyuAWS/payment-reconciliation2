# üí≥ Payment Reconciliation Agent (Demo App)

An AI-powered demo application that automatically reconciles payments with invoices and ledger records. It uses synthetic US-based financial data to identify and explain discrepancies such as duplicate payments, over/underpayments, and missing ledger entries.

---

## üß† What It Does

This demo showcases a **Payment Reconciliation Agent** that:
- Matches **incoming payments** to **outstanding invoices**
- Cross-verifies matched transactions against the **general ledger**
- Detects and explains common reconciliation issues:
  - Duplicate payments
  - Missing payments
  - Mismatched amounts
  - Unknown payers
- Responds to **natural language queries** (e.g., "Why wasn't INV-1003 reconciled?")

---

## üéØ Demo Use Case

Finance teams often spend hours manually reconciling payment records with internal accounting systems. This demo illustrates how AI can automate and simplify that process.

**Target Users:**
- Finance & Accounting Teams
- Controllers and Auditors
- AI/ML Product Buyers
- SaaS Decision Makers

## üìÅ Demo Data

All data is **synthetic** and designed for the **US market**. The app uses three main tables:

### `invoices.csv`
| invoice_id | customer_name | amount_due | due_date   | status |
|------------|----------------|------------|------------|--------|
| INV-1001   | Acme Corp       | 1200.00    | 2025-02-15 | Open   |

### `payments.csv`
| payment_id | payer_name | amount | payment_date | method | reference_note |
|------------|------------|--------|--------------|--------|----------------|
| PAY-501    | Acme Corp  | 1200.00 | 2025-02-15   | ACH    | INV-1001       |

### `ledger.csv`
| ledger_entry_id | invoice_id | payment_id | amount  | entry_date |
|------------------|------------|------------|---------|------------|
| LED-001          | INV-1001   | PAY-501    | 1200.00 | 2025-02-15 |

> Additional anomalies (duplicate payments, partial payments, etc.) are built in to simulate real-world edge cases.

## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Layer          | Tech                     |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Frontend       | React + Tailwind CSS     |
| Data Matching  | Custom JS matching engine|
| Data Storage   | Static TypeScript objects|
| State Management| React Hooks (useState)  |

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Data Load**: Invoices, payments, and ledger entries are loaded from static data.
2. **Matching Engine**:
   - Matches payments to invoices using amount, payer name, and reference note.
   - Verifies matched records against the ledger.
3. **Discrepancy Engine**:
   - Flags and classifies unmatched or inconsistent entries.
   - Uses fuzzy logic to handle naming mismatches.
4. **Explainability Agent**:
   - Accepts natural language questions.
   - Generates reasoning steps and decisions for reconciliation status.

## üí¨ Example Prompts

> These work in the built-in Q&A assistant:

- "Show me unreconciled payments"
- "Why wasn't INV-1003 matched?"
- "Which customers made duplicate payments?"

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/payment-reconciliation-agent.git
cd payment-reconciliation-agent

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:5173

## üîÑ Simulated Data Service

The application now includes a robust simulated data service that provides realistic financial data for demonstration purposes:

- **Dynamic Data Generation**: Creates varied invoices, payments, and ledger entries with realistic patterns
- **Consistent Data Sets**: Ensures data consistency across different API calls
- **Network Simulation**: Includes simulated network delays for realistic API behavior
- **Edge Cases**: Automatically generates common reconciliation challenges like partial payments and mismatched references

### Extending for Real API Integration

The simulated data service is designed with future API integration in mind:

```typescript
// Current simulated API call
const invoices = await getSimulatedInvoices();

// Future real API integration (same interface)
const invoices = await getInvoices(); // Real API call with identical return type
```

This architecture allows for seamless switching between simulated and real data sources without changing component code.
